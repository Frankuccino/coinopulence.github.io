                    <h2>What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>
                    <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that keeps records about balances and transactions on a distributed ledger, which is most commonly in the form of a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies enable peer-to-peer transactions between participants across the globe on a 24/7 basis.
                            
                    A distributed ledger is a database with no central administrator that is maintained by a network of nodes. In permissionless distributed ledgers, anyone is able to join the network and operate a node. In permissioned distributed ledgers, the ability to operate a node is reserved for a pre-approved group of entities.
                            
                    Top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum employ a permissionless design, in which anyone can participate in the process of establishing consensus regarding the current state of the ledger. This enables a high degree of decentralization and resiliency, making it very difficult for a single entity to arbitrarily change the history of transactions.</p>
